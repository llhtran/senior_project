<br/>
Authorship attribution is the problem of analyzing and characterizing an individual’s writing style in order to determine the most likely author for an unlabeled body of natural language text. In recent years, the problem has been approached from a statistical angle by employing deep learning techniques. This senior project aims to explore various, potentially deep, learning models to solve the authorship attribution in conjunction with a number of linguistic methods in order to unders...</p>

<br/>
Authorship attribution has been examined extensively in the past under the field of stylometry. <br/>
<br/>
Character features<br/>
Lexical / Word tokens<br/>
Syntactic<br/>
Semantic<br/>
<br/>
Application: determine authorship, both for literary works and plagiarism<br/>
<br/>
Field has matured to the point researchers are no longer looking for solutions; they are looking for efficient solutions. Eg StankoHsuLu<br/>

Representing features<br/>
One challenging aspect of natural language processing is choosing a good way to quantify language numerically. This necessity arises from the fact that learning models deal exclusively with numerical vectors and matrices in order to “learn” features. Language and style, on the other hand, is completely devoid of numbers. <br/>

<br/>
The project aims to experiment with a variety of machine learning models and datasets in order to elucidate what governs writing style in a number of distinguished classical English-speaking authors. <br/>
<br/>
I wrote Python scripts for pre-processing text data into vectors and matrices of representing linguistic structures with the help of Matthew Hannibal’s spaCy library. The machine learning models came from Python’s scikit library, and I wrote the scripts for configur...</p>
