<br/>
Authorship attribution is the problem of analyzing and characterizing an individual’s writing style in order to determine the most likely author for an unlabeled body of natural language text. In recent years, the problem has been approached from a statistical angle by employing deep learning techniques. This senior project aims to explore various, potentially deep, learning models to solve the authorship attribution in conjunction with a number of linguistic methods in order to unders...</p>

Authorship attribution has been examined extensively in the past under the field of stylometry. </p>

Representing features<br/>
One challenging aspect of natural language processing is choosing a good way to quantify language numerically. This necessity arises from the fact that learning models deal exclusively with numerical vectors and matrices in order to “learn” features. Language and style, on the other hand, is completely devoid of numbers. <br/>

Notes: <br/>
- The bigger question that we want to ask: We want to be able to train a model and let it classify previous unseen texts. How do we make use of the principle components that we observe? </p>
